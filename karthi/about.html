        <h2>About: <br> </h2>
        <p>
            <b>The Cricketer was launched on 15 March 1993 by Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota. It grew with help from students and researchers at universities around the world. Contrary to some reports, Badri Seshadri, who was very instrumental in The Cricketer's early growth, did not become involved in The Cricketer until some months after its founding.The site was reliant on contributions from fans around the world who spent hours compiling electronic scorecards and contributing them to The Cricketer's comprehensive archive, as well as keying in live scores from games around the world using The Cricketer's scoring software, "dougie". In 2000, The Cricketer's estimated worth was $150 million; however it faced difficulties the following year as a result of the dotcom crash.The Cricketer's significant growth in the 1990s made it an attractive site for investors during the peak of the dotcom boom, and in 2000 it received $37 million worth of Satyam Infoway Ltd. shares in exchange for a 25% stake in the company (a valuation of around £100 million). It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about £6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies.</b>

            The Cricketer in 1995
            By late 2002 the company was making a monthly operating profit and was one of very few independent sports sites to avoid collapse (such as Sports.com and Sportal). However, the business was still servicing a large loan. The Cricketer was eventually acquired by Paul Getty's Wisden Group, the publisher of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and The Wisden Cricketer, and renamed Wisden The Cricketer. The Wisden brand (and its own wisden.com site) were eventually phased out in favour of The Cricketer for Wisden's online operations. In December 2005, Wisden re-launched its recently discontinued Wisden Asia Cricket magazine as The Cricketer Magazine, a magazine dedicated to coverage of Indian cricket. The magazine published its last issue in July 2007.
            In 2007, the Wisden Group began to be broken up and sold to other companies; BSkyacquired The Wisden Cricketer, while Sony Corporation acquired the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system.[11] In June 2007, ESPN Inc. announced that it had acquired The Cricketer from the Wisden Group.[12] The acquisition was intended to help further expand The Cricketer by combining the site with ESPN's other web properties, including ESPN.com and ESPN Soccernet. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
            As of 2023, Sambit Bal is the Editor-in-Chief of ESPNThe Cricketer. In 2013, ESPNThe Cricketer.com celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a series of online features. The website awards the annual ESPNThe Cricketer Awards.[citation needed].On 20 March 2023, ESPNThe Cricketer celebrated its 30th anniversary by an article from Sambit Bal, their Editor-in-Chief.In 2000, The Cricketer was named title sponsor of the Women's World Cup.
